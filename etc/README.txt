Do not move these files to the system /etc directory.

Files in this directory stay right where they are!

about:      Lines in this file are added to the end of the "About"
            page of the configuration menu. Put descriptive text
            for your application here and users will see it when 
            the system is in configure mode.

netenable:  A list of network interface devices, and an "enabled/
            disabled" identifier that tells the system whether to
            enable or disable that interface at boot time. (Example:
            "wlan0: disable", see comments in that file.)
